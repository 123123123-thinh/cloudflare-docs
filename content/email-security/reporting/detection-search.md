# Detection search

**Detection search** allows you to search through and view all emails that Area 1 has marked with a [detection disposition](/email-security/reference/dispositions-and-attributes/).

You would commonly use detection search to get visibility into *why* and *when* Area 1 marked a message as such. 

{{<Aside type="note">}}
To review all emails — not just those marked with a disposition — use [Mailtrace](/email-security/reporting/mailtrace/).
