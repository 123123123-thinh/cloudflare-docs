# API deployment setup

When you first get started with Area 1, you will need to set up a way to connect your current mail environment with Area 1:

- **BCC setup**: Send messages to Area 1 via BCC configurations within your email provider:

   - [Office 365 BCC Setup](#link-needed)
   - [GSuite BCC Setup](/email-security/static/GSuite-BCC-Setup.pdf)
   - [Cisco BCC Setup](/email-security/static/Cisco-BCC-Setup.pdf)
   - [Microsoft Exchange BCC Setup](#link-needed)

- **Journalling setup**: Send messages to Area 1 via a Journalling configuration within your email provider:

   - [Office 365 Journalling Setup](#link-needed)
   - [GSuite Journalling Setup](/email-security/static/GSuite-Journalling-Setup.pdf)
   - [Microsoft Exchange Journalling Setup](#link-needed)

## Next steps

Regardless of your setup (BCC or Journalling), you may also want to set up either manual or automatic [retraction](/email-security/email-configuration/retract-settings/) to take post-delivery actions against suspicious messages.
