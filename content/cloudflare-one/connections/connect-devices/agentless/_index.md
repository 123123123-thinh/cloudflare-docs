# Agentless options

If you are unable to install the WARP client on your devices (for example, Windows server does not suppprt the WARP client), you can use agentless options to perform a subset of Gateway functions.

- **[Agentless DNS filtering](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/dns)** requires changing your local DNS resolver to Cloudflare.
- **[Agentless remote browser isolation](/cloudflare-one/policies/browser-isolation/clientless-browser-isolation/)** requires users to go to a specific Cloudflare URL when browsing the Internet.
- **[Agentless HTTP filtering](/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/agentless/http)** requires configuring your browser to forward traffic to a Cloudflare proxy server.
